# Eggheadio Introduction To Reactive Programming

Learnings and annotations from https://egghead.io/courses/introduction-to-reactive-programming

1. [Understand reactive programming using RxJs]('./01/index.js');

    ```bash
    $ node 01
    ```
2. [Use an event stream of double clicks]('./02/index.js')

    ```bash
    $ npx live-server 02
    ```
3. [Why hoose RxJs]('./03/index.js')

    Key takeaway:

    Why should one use event streams?

    > Event streams allow one to specify the dynamic behaviour of a value
    > completely at the time of declaration.

    ^ this sounds awfully similar to *determinism* in state charts

    ```bash
    $ node 03
    ```
